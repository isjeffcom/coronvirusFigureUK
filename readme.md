## Importance
1. Due to the announcement channel and structure are constantly changing, new data update will put into current_shadow table waiting for admin approve. Admin need to `GET`: http://HOST/approve?token= with token in the first row (id=1) of your user table, to update to official current table.

2. Use `GET`: http://HOST/update?token= to manually update all data (you need to approve the new data as well)

3. The false data may cause chaos to the public, please be careful. 

4. As I am not a professional coder (I am a designer), I am welcome if anyone could help me make improvement. You can contact me through ISSUE page

5. If you are using this API, please be make sure data has cache and fault tolerance was considered. This is API is not completely reliable at all time.
